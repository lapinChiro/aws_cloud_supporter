  MetricsAnalyzer Integration Tests - 20 Patterns
    1. Complete Application Templates
      ✓ 1-1: Web application complete template with all 6 resource types (797 ms)
      ✓ 1-2: Serverless application template with SAM transform (261 ms)
      ✓ 1-3: Minimal Lambda template (129 ms)
    2. Large Scale & Performance
      ✓ 2-1: Large template with 478 resources (6221 ms)
      ✓ 2-2: Memory limit enforcement (79 ms)
    3. Edge Cases & Error Handling
      ✓ 3-1: Empty resources template (36 ms)
      ✓ 3-2: Invalid YAML syntax (34 ms)
      ✓ 3-3: Non-existent file path (16 ms)
      ✓ 3-4: Mixed supported and unsupported resources (90 ms)
    4. Resource-Specific Behavior
      ✓ 4-1: RDS with different engines (61 ms)
      ✓ 4-2: Lambda with different memory sizes (53 ms)
      ✓ 4-3: ECS Fargate vs EC2 (51 ms)
      ✓ 4-4: DynamoDB with different billing modes (54 ms)
      ✓ 4-5: ALB with different schemes (72 ms)
    5. Output Format Tests
      ✓ 5-1: JSON output format validation (152 ms)
      ✓ 5-2: HTML output format validation (263 ms)
    6. Options & Filtering
      ✓ 6-1: Include low importance metrics option (92 ms)
      ✓ 6-2: Resource type filtering (171 ms)
      ✓ 6-3: Verbose mode logging (33 ms)
    7. Concurrent Processing
      ✕ 7-1: Different concurrency levels (6670 ms)
    8. Integration with All Components
      ✓ 8-1: Full pipeline - Parse, Extract, Generate, Format (42 ms)
      ✓ 8-2: Error recovery with continueOnError option (22 ms)
